            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My Name is Seth Joseph Schoenert. This is a little bit about my background, and what lead my life to becoming a FullStack Developer.
            </p>
            <p>  
                I grew up in a small town just outside of Portland, Oregon; named Sherwood. From a young age I took a liking to competitive hobbies such as chess, football, basketball,
                and especially online gaming. Because I grew up In the 2000s and 2010s, computer technology was a huge part of my life and I was always intrigued by how simple it was to use, 
                yet how complex it was to create, or so I thought at the time. As I grew into my teenage years and struggled to find a school subject I looked forward to, I tended to gravitate my thoughts towards video games while 
                in class which took a hit to my mental health and GPA. I knew I wanted to find a way to increase my knowledge in somthing with tangible value. This is when I was forced to take a Computer Science class 
                in order to fill out my elective credits; and finally found what I was searching for. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After my first open learning CS class where I choose to study HTML and CSS for an hour a day, I knew this could be a logical career path, so I loaded my schedule with more of them and began to build relationship
                with my favorite teacher of all time T Smith, while learning the basics of front end and back end web development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I graduated highschool and knew I wanted o study computer science in college, I tried, but the new online learning enviornment during the pandemic made me lose my grasp of why I wanted to follow
                that path in the first place. I ended up dropping out as I didn't think the price tag was worth it and began working for my dad at his winery, while also diving into the Web3 space, first as an investor,
                until I made some friends online and found a job as a social media/community manager. In this time meeting so many people while hosting online events, or just chatting, I began to see the value in web technology
                again, and saw a way I could apply it to a new technology that I had became so fond of (application blockchains). This leads me to where I am now, enrolled in the online fullstack bootcamp at UT Austin, 
                where I have a clear vision of my future and can't wait to overcome the challenges ahead.
